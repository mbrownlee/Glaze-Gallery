<h1>Glaze Gallery</h1>

Front end capstone project by Michelle McLane Brownlee NSS C40 7/7/2020

<h3>Overview</h3>
Potters have no consistent way to track glaze results with technology. This app is designed to allow potters to document the process of each pot including glaze details and before/after photos.
Poters can also view results achieved by other potters. If desired, a potter can keep details of his process private.

<h3>Details</h3>
Potters can create account, login to an existing account, and logout.
Each potter can create, view, edit, and delete pots created by him. Potters can track clays used, techniques, glazes, firing schedules, and before/after firing photos.
Each potter can view the view the details of pots not created by him. For those marked private, a potter can only view the finished photo and the name of the artist.
